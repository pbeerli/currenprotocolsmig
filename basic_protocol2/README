This directory contains all files generated in the Basic Protocol 2.
The tutorial recreates all these files.

the basic_protocol2.sh creates the temp_protocol2 directory and all outfiles and the model probability table.
the basic_protocol2_mpi.sh is equivalent to basic_protocol2.sh except that it uses the parallel migrate version, see Advanced support protocol.

To use the bf.py utility you will need to copy it into the working directory.
